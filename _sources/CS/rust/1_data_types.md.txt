# Data Types

General Notes:
- By default all variables are immutable, you have to explicitly state `let mut ...` 


## Boolean

Mutable / Immutable
```rust
// immutable 
let mybool1: bool = true;

// mutable
let mut mybool2: bool = true;
mybool2 = false;
```

## Integers/Floats

Mutable / Immutable
```rust
// without "mut" a primitive is immutable
let myint1: i32 = 0;
// this code errors because myint is immutable
myint1 += 1;

// this is a mutable int
let mut myint2: i32 = 0;
myint2 += 1;
```

Pointer and de-referencing
```rust
// this is a pointer to myint2, thus it shares memory
let myint3: &i32 = &myint2;
// this code error because a pointer is immutable by default
myint3 += 1;

// what you can do is de-reference the pointer with *
// NOTE however arithmetic operation is Rust by default auto-dereference so * here is redundant (but explicit)
let myint4: i32 = *myint3 + 1;

// all the same for floats as ints, for example
let pi: f32 = 3.14;
```

## Char / String / Str Slice

A single character is a `char` and it is in single quotes
```rust
// char is a single character. IMPORTANT: this is subtle but notice a char is '' not "" because "" is reserved for strings
let mychar: char = 'a';
```

String vs String Slice (&str)

- by default "some text" is a `String Slice` in Rust unless casted to `String` explicitly
- `String` is mutable (if defined `mut`) these are OWNED, vs `String Slice` is immutable reference (BORROWED)
- Strings because they are mutable are allocated on the HEAP and because of that are slow to access
- &str are fixed in size and are references to a specific location on the STACK, thus they are very fast to access

Strings
```rust
// there are 2 ways to define a string:
// NOTE: : is for decleration, :: is for accessing functions/methods/constants of a type
let mut mystr1: String = "Hello".to_string(); // converted from String Slice with .to_string()
let mut mystr2: String = String::from("Hello"); // converted from String
// to add to string, we push
mystr1.push_str(" Vik");
println!("{mystr1}");
```

String Slice
```rust
let mystr3: &str = &mystr1;
// note that technically the above is a slice of the entire string, we can also slice it down by
let mystr4: &str = &mystr1[..5];
println!("{mystr4}");
// to key onto a specific char you have to turn it into an iter
let mychar1 = &mystr1.chars().nth(1).unwrap();
```

How to combine strings
```rust
// combine strings
let mystr5 = "hi".to_string();
let mystr6 = "Vik".to_string();

let mystr7 = format!("Combined via format!: {mystr5} {mystr6}!");

// alternatively you can use array/vec join
let my_string_arr: [&str;2] = [&mystr5, &mystr6];
let my_string = my_string_arr.join(" ");
println!("{my_string}");
```

How to split strings
```rust
// how to split on space(s)
let split_str: Vec<&str> = "this has   many  spaces".to_string().split_whitespace().collect();
```

How to type convert strings (ex: string int to int)
```rust
// how to type convert
let split_int: Vec<i32> = "1,2,3,4".split(',').map(|val|val.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).collect();

```

# Arrays
These are fixed sized, same type values


How to define an array
```rust
// define it with [type;size]
let numbers1 = [1,2,3];
let numbers2: [i32; 3] = [1,2,3];
// note because there is no default string formatter for arrays you can use debug formatter
println!("{:?} with index 0 = {}", numbers2, numbers2[0]);

// how to init an array (repeat) with values, ex: fill array with 10s for size 3 array
// IMPORTANT: size has to be a constant during compile time. Therefore you cannot dynamically set this lets say from a len() of something
// for that use vec instead
let numbers3 = [10; 3];

// by default all things in Rust are immutable so if we wanted to update an array we have to declare it mut
let mut numbers4: [i32;3] = [1,2,3];
numbers4[0] = 10;
println!("{numbers4:?}");
```

How to slice an array
```rust
let numberslice: &[i32] = &numbers2[..2];
println!("{numberslice:?}");
```

# Tuples
- tuples are fixed size but of mixed type
- unlike in arrays, we do not need to specify types (Rust will infer it if you want, nor do we need to specify size)

```rust
let mytuple1 = (3, true);
let mytuple2: (i32, bool) = (3, true);

// by default all things in Rust are immutable so if we wanted to change index 0 we would have to declare it mut
let mut mytuple3: (i32,bool) = (3, true);
// note that tuple indexing is different than other types (array/vec) it is done with .0
mytuple3.0 = 5;
// note while this tuple is mutable, you cannot change its original index type
mytuple3.0 = true; // this will throw an error
```

# Vectors

- vectors are like arrays in that they have to contain the same value types however the size can change
- you have to declare it's type with `<type>`

```rust
let vec1: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

// you can let Rust infer type of a non-empty vec
let mut vec2 = vec![1,2,3];

// initialize vec with values (repeat)
let vec3 = [0].repeat(5);

// add to a vec
vec2.push(4);

// remove last element
vec2.pop();

// index to
println!("index 1 of vec = {}", &vec2[1]);

// slice
println!("index 0:2 of vec = {:?}", &vec2[..2]);

// indexing out of bounds will cause an error
&vec2[99]; // this will throw an error

// however using .get(index) will return an Option enum, thats option of value or None
let result = &vec2.get(99);
let results = match result {
    Some(val) => val,
    None => &0
};

// how to update values of vec
for val in &mut vec2 {
    // note because we are looping over the ref values of vec2, to update it we have to declare it &mut (mutable ref), 
    // and when updating the vals, we need to remember that we cannot update ref vals, so we must dereference it with *val
    *val += 10; 
}
```

# Hashset

```rust
// create a hashset
let mut hashset: HashSet<i32> = HashSet::new();

// add to it
hashset.insert(0);
hashset.insert(0); // note that hashsets only store unique values
hashset.insert(1);
println!("{:?}", hashset);

// you can also call the usual hashset operations like .difference .intersection etc.
```

# Hashmap

```rust
// init a hashmap
let mut hashmap1: HashMap<&str, i32> = HashMap::new();

// add to it
hashmap1.insert("Vik", 1);
hashmap1.insert("Nicole", 2);
// you can overwrite existing keys
hashmap1.insert("Vik", 5);

// get a specific key's value
let result = hashmap1.get("Vik").expect("key not in hashmap");
// get a key and if not in hashmap return a default
let result = hashmap1.get("Lexie").unwrap_or(&0);

// loop over hashmap
for (key, val) in hashmap1.iter(){
    println!("key = {key}, val = {val}");
}

// update based on key'ed values
for key in ["Vik", "Avery"] {
    // get a value if exists otherwise add it with default value
    let count = hashmap1.entry(key).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}
```

# Struct
`struct`'s are as close to **Object Oriented classes** as you can get in Rust. A struct does not need to have `impl` (implementation) that most similar to **methods** of a **class**, in which case it's most similar to a **named tuple**.

```rust
// create a struct that has named field: name, age
struct Human{
    name: String,
    age: i32
}

// at this point the struct is most similar to a named tuple

// now we can implement a method that is now closer to how a class object would work with its instance data
impl Human{
    fn introduce(&self){
        println!("Hi, my name is {} and I am {} old.", self.name, self.age)
    }

    fn update_age(&mut self, age: i32){
        self.age = age;
    }
}

let mut person = Human{name:"Vik".to_string(), age: 20};
println!("person.age = {}",person.age);
person.introduce();
person.update_age(21);
person.introduce();
```

# Enum
`enum`'s are state carrying data structures that are used in combination with `match` (like options in other languages). There are 2 types of enums:

- TYPE 1: no data carrying enum, useful for state selection

```rust
// step 1: define enum states
enum TrafficLight{
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green
}
// step 2: define current state by instantiating it from enum
let traffic_light_state = TrafficLight::Red;
// step 3: use it with match to do something based on state match
match traffic_light_state {
    TrafficLight::Red => println!("Stop!"),
    TrafficLight::Yellow => println!("Slow down!"),
    TrafficLight::Green => println!("Go!"),
}
// step 3-improved: use in a function
fn tell_me_what_to_do(traffic_light_state: TrafficLight){
    match traffic_light_state {
        TrafficLight::Red => println!("Stop!"),
        TrafficLight::Yellow => println!("Slow down!"),
        TrafficLight::Green => println!("Go!"),
    }
}
```
- TYPE 2: data carrying enum, useful for state selection that needs to perform on state data

```rust
// step 1: define enum states with types
enum Shapes {
    circle(f64),
    rectangle(f64, f64)
}
// step 2: instance enum with data
let myshape = Shapes::circle(1.5);
// step 3: use it with match that works on state+data
let area = match myshape {
    Shapes::circle(r) => 3.14 * r.powi(2),
    Shapes::rectangle(w,h) => w * h
};
// step 3-improved: use in a function
fn area(myshape:Shapes)->f64{
    match myshape {
        Shapes::circle(r) => 3.14 * r.powi(2),
        Shapes::rectangle(w,h) => w * h
    }
}
```
