# Data Types

General Notes:
- By default all variables are immutable, you have to explicitly state `let mut ...` 


## Boolean

Mutable / Immutable
```rust
// immutable 
let mybool1: bool = true;

// mutable
let mut mybool2: bool = true;
mybool2 = false;
```

## Integers/Floats

Mutable / Immutable
```rust
// without "mut" a primitive is immutable
let myint1: i32 = 0;
// this code errors because myint is immutable
myint1 += 1;

// this is a mutable int
let mut myint2: i32 = 0;
myint2 += 1;


Pointer and de-referencing
```rust
// this is a pointer to myint2, thus it shares memory
let myint3: &i32 = &myint2;
// this code error because a pointer is immutable by default
myint3 += 1;

// what you can do is de-reference the pointer with *
// NOTE however arithmetic operation is Rust by default auto-dereference so * here is redundant (but explicit)
let myint4: i32 = *myint3 + 1;

// all the same for floats as ints, for example
let pi: f32 = 3.14;
```

## Char / String / Str Slice

A single character is a `char` and it is in single quotes
```rust
// char is a single character. IMPORTANT: this is subtle but notice a char is '' not "" because "" is reserved for strings
let mychar: char = 'a';
```

String vs String Slice (&str)
- by default "some text" is a `String Slice` in Rust unless casted to `String` explicitly
- `String` is mutable (if defined `mut`) these are OWNED, vs `String Slice` is immutable reference (BORROWED)
- Strings because they are mutable are allocated on the HEAP and because of that are slow to access
- &str are fixed in size and are references to a specific location on the STACK, thus they are very fast to access

Strings
```rust
// there are 2 ways to define a string:
// NOTE: : is for decleration, :: is for accessing functions/methods/constants of a type
let mut mystr1: String = "Hello".to_string(); // converted from String Slice with .to_string()
let mut mystr2: String = String::from("Hello"); // converted from String
// to add to string, we push
mystr1.push_str(" Vik");
println!("{mystr1}");
```

String Slice
```rust
let mystr3: &str = &mystr1;
// note that technically the above is a slice of the entire string, we can also slice it down by
let mystr4: &str = &mystr1[..5];
println!("{mystr4}");
// to key onto a specific char you have to turn it into an iter
let mychar1 = &mystr1.chars().nth(1).unwrap();
```

How to combine strings
```rust
// combine strings
let mystr5 = "hi".to_string();
let mystr6 = "Vik".to_string();

let mystr7 = format!("Combined via format!: {mystr5} {mystr6}!");

// alternatively you can use array/vec join
let my_string_arr: [&str;2] = [&mystr5, &mystr6];
let my_string = my_string_arr.join(" ");
println!("{my_string}");
```

How to split strings
```rust
// how to split on space(s)
let split_str: Vec<&str> = "this has   many  spaces".to_string().split_whitespace().collect();
```

How to type convert strings (ex: string int to int)
```rust
// how to type convert
let split_int: Vec<i32> = "1,2,3,4".split(',').map(|val|val.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).collect();

```
