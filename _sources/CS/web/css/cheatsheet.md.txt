# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## General

### How to paragraph link within the same page
This is actually all done on the HTML side (not CSS), however the scroll-behavior makes the side much nicer
when following a same-page link
``` html
<a href="#link_id1"></a>

<h1 id="link_id1">Hello</h1>
```

``` css
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

### How to create "dark-mode" without a lot of work
Setup a toggle to change the entire html tag's behavior to "black" and apply a filter to invert all colors.
Now the hue-rotate is required if you want to keep the similar colors but in lighter mode for the black background to work

``` css
html {
    background: navy;
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

### How to remove an existing CSS style

```css
div {
    width: unset;
}

```


## Fonts

### Custom fonts from google
Google offers a 1000+ selection of fonts to pick from with an easy to embed link.

1. Pick a font (or combine multiple fonts!) from [LINK](https://fonts.google.com/)
2. Click "Select this style"
3. top right should have a icon for you to click that will pop up a "Use on the web" link
4. paste the link in your html template
5. call out the font on your css temple 

### How to change the selection styling

``` css
p::selection {
    background: rgb(125,125,125);
    color: white;
}
```

## Backgrounds

### How to create custom clipped background
There are a lot of really great tools out there to auto generate `polygon` shapes for you
that is then used to clip a background (either an image or solid color) to get abstract background fast!
Link to polygon generator: [LINK](https://www.cssportal.com/css-clip-path-generator/)

``` css
body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: rgb(125,125,125);
    clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0 59%, 25% 100%);
}
```

### How to blend background together
This is a really cool feature to blend a background image with a solid color to quickly
customize the look of a background

``` css
body {
    background-image: url(img.png);
    background-color: blue;
    background-blend-mode: screen;
}
```
