# Microsoft Excel Tips/Tricks

## How to define custom functions (without vba/.xlsm) - M365 Lambda Functions
In M365 you can define custom function with using VBA (and saving your workbook as .xlsm macro enabled) by:

Local cell (1 time use):
You can define a `lambda` function within a cell for a 1 time use. Ex: `lambda=(x, y, x+y)`

Reusable function name:

1. Formulas Tab > Name manager (under Defined Names) > New
2. Type the name of the function (must be alpha - no numbers or special char)
3. Select scope 
    - workbook is for all worksheet
    - Sheet scope will only work for this sheet
    - note it's best practice to have variables be local to sheets (unless shared) and function be workbook
      you'll be greatly annoyed when you go through a big project and have to swap a ton of variables to Sheet
4. Refers to type `lambda=(x, y, x+y)`

The way `lambda` functions work is that they take n-args first, then last "arg" is your custom function that must return a value or matrix of values

- example 1 arg: `=lambda(x, x+1)`
- example 2 args: `lambda=(x, y, x+y)`
- example matrix return: `lambda=(x, let(total, sum(x), x / total))`

## How to reference a matrix
- Before M365 you could reference an entire range as your matrix. Ex `A1:B2` for a 2x2 matrix
- In M365 feature, and it's done by adding a `#` after the master header matrix. `=A1#`
