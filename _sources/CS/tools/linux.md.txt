# Linux Cheatsheet

## Setup

- To add python to PATH (note this appends to path, simply put `$PATH:...` for prepend): `export PATH="/C/Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38:$PATH"`
- To add python scripts (pytest etc.) to PATH: `export PATH="/C/Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts:$PATH"`
- To add java to PATH: `export PATH="/C/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/Programs/AdoptOpenJDK/jdk-11.0.8.10-hotspot/bin:$PATH"`
- To set an alias: `alias python38="winpty /C/Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe"
- To ssh: `alias ssh_server1="ssh username@servername.com"`


## General

- To clear terminal window text: `clear`
- To copy text from terminal: simply highlight the text
- To paste text into terminal: `Shift` + `Insert`
- To change directories: `cd folder1/folder2`
- To back out a directory: `cd ..` then back out 2 and so on: `cd ../..`
- To back out to home directory: `cd ~`
- To go back to the previous directory: `cd -`
- To create a directory: `mkdir folder1`
- To create a file: `touch file.txt`
- To concatenate 2 files: `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file2.txt`

    - Pipe to a file: `>`
    - To append to a file: `>>`

- To to print file content to terminal: `cat file1.txt`
- To execute a file: `./file1.txt`
- To remove a file: `rm file1.txt`
- To remove a folder: `rm -r folder1`
- To rename a file/folder: `mv file1.txt file2.txt`
- To get current working directory: `pwd`
- To get list of files/folders in your current working directory: `dir -la` or `ls -la` (-l for long desc, -a for hidden)
- To get a list of files sorted from oldest to newest on the bottom: `ll -lrt`
- To search for text in files/folders: `grep -r "GRID.*100" *.bdf` (note grep can be fed regex)

## File Permissions

- To get list of files/folders with permission levels in your current working directory: `dir -la` or `ll`
- To change file/folder permissions: `chmod -R u=rwx folder`

    - `-R` is recursively change all files/folder under the given folder
    - `u` is for "user", `g` for "group", `o` for "other" and `a` for "all"
    - `r` for "read", `w` for "write", `x` for "execute"

- To change group of a file/folder: `chgrp new_groupname file.txt`
- To check which groups you belong to: `groups`
- numbering cheatsheet

    - 0 = none
    - 1 = execute
    - 2 = write
    - 3 = write + execute
    - 4 = read
    - 5 = read + execute
    - 6 = read + write
    - 7 = all

- sticky bits allows more control over files in a folder. If sticky bit is set on a folder only the root owner and directory owner can rename/delete files, otherwise anyone with write/execute can rename/delete. You set sticky on a folder by `chmod +t .` or `chmod 0### .` where ### is whatever regular permissions you want

## How to find/grep
To be safe always put what you are trying to match in `"this.*"` so that regex works correctly

- `-r` recursive
- `-i` ignore case
- `-w` whole word match
- Find folder name: `find -type d | grep "foldername"`

## Scripting

- To print datetime: `date +%m%d%y` (note lower case is short form, upper case is long form)
- To declare a variable in a script: `variable1 = "this"` and to call it `$variable1`
