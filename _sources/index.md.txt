# Welcome to Vik's Blue Prints
A place for all of my personal notes mainly related to Science, Tech, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Some of the notes are full-blown tutorials with a problem statement, derivation and example problem, while others are a collection of "how-to's". 

These notes were written on 100% my own time as a hobby/skill-maintenance with 100% publicly available sources such as books/articles/posts. Like many other's creative content they do take a lot of time to develop so the only thing I would like to ask for is to properly cite the content you may use, whether directly from my posts or the references I used to create my posts. Cheers!
