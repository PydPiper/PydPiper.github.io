# Welcome to Vik's Blue Prints
A place for all of my personal notes mainly related to Science, Tech, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Some of the notes are full-blown tutorials with a problem statement, derivation and example problem, while others are a collection of "how-to's". For video tutorials check out [VixBluePrint on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@vixblueprints)

These notes were written 100% by me (no GenAI used) on 100% my own time as a hobby/skill-maintenance with 100% publicly available sources such as books/articles/posts. Like many other's creative content they do take a lot of time to develop so the only thing I would like to ask for is to properly cite the content you may use, whether directly from my posts or the references I used to create my posts. Cheers! 

## About Me
Viktor holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineer and a M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Professionally, Viktor has 13+ years of work experience in the Structures Aerospace industry working on various stages of the lifecycle. From a "blank page" Product Development all the way to aircraft sustaining, ensuring our aircrafts meet structural integrity of our in-service fleet. As for my tasks, I have worked as a Structures Design Engineer, on both new airplane design as well as in-service fleet support. I’ve worked as a Structures Stress Analyst on derivative and new airplane development where I was responsible for primary/secondary structure static/fatigue/discrete source damage analysis. Currently I am working in a Structures Finite Element Simulation team supporting fine grid component level modeling for the various commercial programs.

Over the years I’ve had the pleasure of mentoring from some of the industry’s best to not only grow/learn but to better understand the workflow of my counterparts so that I can make more informed big picture decision on the work that I do today. The road of an engineer is certainly a path continuous learning and whether it was mentoring, publications, certifications or most recently finish my masters, I’ve certainly embraced an engineer’s growth mindset.
